#Guess the Number Game
This is a Java-based console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player has 4 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides hints to indicate whether the number is higher or lower than the player's guess. The game concludes when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.

#Features:-
*)Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated at the start of the game.
*)User Input: The player inputs their guess using the console.
*)Hints: After each guess, the player is told if the actual number is greater or less than their guess.
*)Attempts: The player has 4 chances to guess the number. After each incorrect guess, the remaining attempts are displayed.
*)Game Over: If the player runs out of attempts, the game reveals the correct number.
*)Winning Condition: The player wins if they guess the correct number before exhausting all attempts.
*)This project is a great example of using loops, conditional statements, and random number generation in Java to build a simple, interactive game.
